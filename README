The goal is to create a simple system statistics gathering tool that is very light on the system(s) you’re monitoring that’s also very easy to use.

PeepStats will consist of a poller and an agent. Since we want to be nice to our servers, the bulk of the workload should be on the monitoring machines, right?

The agent will stay thin, but should be easy to add monitoring to.
As for the poller … I don’t know yet, I’ll probably make a module for a greater monitoring framework.
